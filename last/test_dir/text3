Planning Is Good ,But Doing Is Better

Planning is good as it decides in detail how we do.However,a plan can bear no fruit without being actually carried out.

My experience in the English speech contest last October is a case in point.A month before the event,I spent hours working out a schedule outlining my goals and practical steps.After that,I set out to read widely for an inspiring topic,wrote a speech,and practiced its delivery in beautiful pronunciation with good public speech skills.I finally came out of the contest as the first prize winner.

I know how I achieved my success. It came from good planning and better doing combined.
